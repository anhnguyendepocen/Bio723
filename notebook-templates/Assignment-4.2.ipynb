      "2.  For the male birds, calculate the relative fitness of each individual as $w = cW$ where $W$ is the absolute fitness of each individual (1 or 0 if the lived or died, respectively) and $c$ is total number of individuals divided by the number that survived.\n",

Based on your analysis, determine which phenotypic traits are good predictors of fitness in this data set.  Justify your conclusion using information from the regression function, diagnostic plots, vector geometric consideration, raw data plots, etc.\n",
