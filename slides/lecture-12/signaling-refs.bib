	Abstract = {The spatial and temporal organization of molecules within a cell is critical for coordinating the many distinct activities carried out by the cell. In an increasing number of biological signaling processes, scaffold proteins have been found to play a central role in physically assembling the relevant molecular components. Although most scaffolds use a simple tethering mechanism to increase the efficiency of interaction between individual partner molecules, these proteins can also exert complex allosteric control over their partners and are themselves the target of regulation. Scaffold proteins offer a simple, flexible strategy for regulating selectivity in pathways, shaping output behaviors, and achieving new responses from preexisting signaling components. As a result, scaffold proteins have been exploited by evolution, pathogens, and cellular engineers to reshape cellular behavior.},

	that the all-or-none character of the response is generated by the
	mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Analysis of individual
	oocytes showed that the response of MAPK to progesterone or Mos was
	equivalent to that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient
	of at least 35, more than 10 times the Hill coefficient for the binding
	of oxygen to hemoglobin. The response can be accounted for by the
	intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the oocyte's MAPK cascade and a positive
	feedback loop in which the cascade is embedded. These findings provide

	Abstract = {It is widely appreciated that the regulated translocation of signaling
	proteins can increase the specificity and speed of signal transduction.
	It is less obvious that regulated translocation can also, in principle,
	turn a graded response into a more switch-like one. For example,
	if two or more signaling proteins are induced to translocate, the
	result can be a switch-like, ultrasensitive response. A switch-like
	response will also occur if translocation raises the local concentration
	of a signaling protein sufficiently to partially saturate the enzyme
	that inactivates it. These mechanisms are likely to make the mitotic
	activation of CDC2 (which is accompanied by the nuclear translocation
	of both CDC2-cyclin-B1 and its activator, CDC25C) and the growth-factor-induced
	activation of MAP kinase (which, upon sustained activation, concentrates

	Abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved
	series of three protein kinases implicated in diverse biological
	processes. Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected
	consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate
	equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted
	to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not
	assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively.
	Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed
	this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found
	to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient
	of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein
	hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make
	the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like
	mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a
	cell switches from one discrete state to another.},

@article{Kholodenko1997,
	Abstract = {A conceptual framework is developed for the quantitative analysis
	of signal transfer through cellular signal transduction pathways
	and networks. This approach is referred to as signal transfer analysis
	and is based on formalisms that were first developed for the analysis
	of metabolic networks. Signal transduction is quantified as the sensitivity,
	known as the response coefficient of a target (e.g. an ion channel
	or transcription factor) to a signal (e.g. a hormone, growth factor
	or neurotransmitter). This response coefficient is defined in terms
	of the fractional change in the activated target brought about by
	a small fractional change in the signal. Quantifying the signal transduction
	in this way makes it possible to prove that for an idealized signaling
	cascade without feedback loops, the total response equals the product
	of all the local response coefficients, one for each level of the
	cascade. We show under which conditions merely having more levels
	in a cascade can boost the sensitivity of a target to a signal. If
	a signal propagates to a target through two different routes, these
	routes contribute independently to the total response, provided there
	is no feedback from the target. This independence makes the behavior
	of signaling cascades different from that of metabolic pathways,
	where different branches are connected through Kirchhoffs law. The
	relations between the total response and the local kinetics at each
	level are given for a number of network structures, such as branched
	signaling pathways and pathways with feedback. The formalism introduced
	here may provide a general approach to quantify cellular information
	transfer.},

@article{Malleshaiah2010,
	Abstract = {Evolution has resulted in numerous innovations that allow organisms to increase their fitness by choosing particular mating partners, including secondary sexual characteristics, behavioural patterns, chemical attractants and corresponding sensory mechanisms. The haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae selects mating partners by interpreting the concentration gradient of pheromone secreted by potential mates through a network of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling proteins. The mating decision in yeast is an all-or-none, or switch-like, response that allows cells to filter weak pheromone signals, thus avoiding inappropriate commitment to mating by responding only at or above critical concentrations when a mate is sufficiently close. The molecular mechanisms that govern the switch-like mating decision are poorly understood. Here we show that the switching mechanism arises from competition between the MAPK Fus3 and a phosphatase Ptc1 for control of the phosphorylation state of four sites on the scaffold protein Ste5. This competition results in a switch-like dissociation of Fus3 from Ste5 that is necessary to generate the switch-like mating response. Thus, the decision to mate is made at an early stage in the pheromone pathway and occurs rapidly, perhaps to prevent the loss of the potential mate to competitors. We argue that the architecture of the Fus3-Ste5-Ptc1 circuit generates a novel ultrasensitivity mechanism, which is robust to variations in the concentrations of these proteins. This robustness helps assure that mating can occur despite stochastic or genetic variation between individuals. The role of Ste5 as a direct modulator of a cell-fate decision expands the functional repertoire of scaffold proteins beyond providing specificity and efficiency of information processing. Similar mechanisms may govern cellular decisions in higher organisms and be disrupted in cancer.},

@article{Shen-Orr2002,
	Abstract = {Little is known about the design principles of transcriptional regulation
	networks that control gene expression in cells. Recent advances in
	data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented
	amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand
	these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks
	into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely
	used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network
	motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different
	parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in
	randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically
	detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation
	networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia
	coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances
	of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific
	function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal
	expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external
	signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable
	view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism.
	This approach may help define the basic computational elements of
	other biological networks.},

@article{Dassow2000,
	Abstract = {All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.},

@article{Milo2002,
	Abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},
