Bio 723 Participants,

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled in or expressed interest in Bio 723: Statistical Computing for Biologists (Fall 2014).  

** Our first class session is Tuesday, August 26 from 3:05-5:35pm in FFSC 4233. ***

Please read this email in its entirety, as there are a number of tasks I'd like you to complete before our first class session.


Course Website
==============

The following wiki will serve as the course website for the semester. Lecture slides, the course workbook, reading assignments, and a variety of resources and links will be posted regularly to this site so I recommend you bookmark it for easy access:

Computing Resources
====================

I assume you have access to a laptop computer on which you have administrative access (so you can install software). PLEASE BRING YOUR LAPTOP TO EVERY CLASS SESSION. A Mac or Windows machine will work equally well.  Whatever operating system your machine runs, please make sure it's relatively up to date (OSX 10.8 or 10.9; Windows 7 or 8). If you use an outdated operating system (OSX 10.6 or earlier; Windows Vista or earlier) you are likely to run into compatibility problems with some of the software packages we'll be using.

In addition to your own laptop, we will make use of linux-based "virtual machines" provided by OIT.  During the first class session I will walk you through the process of creating and connecting to your virtual machine.


Software Tools
==============
